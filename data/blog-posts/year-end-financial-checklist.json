It is the ideal time to:\n\n- Capture tax benefits before they expire\n- Review what worked and what did not\n- Set up systems for next year\n- Start January ahead instead of behind\n\nThis checklist covers everything to address before the ball drops.\n\n## The 10-Item Year-End Checklist\n\n### 1. Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts (If Possible)\n\n**Deadlines:**\n- 401(k): Contributions must be made by December 31 through payroll\n- HSA: Can contribute until April 15 for prior year\n- IRA: Can contribute until April 15 for prior year\n\n**Actions:**\n- Check how much you have contributed to 401(k)\n- If not maxed, see if you can increase final paychecks\n- HSA and IRA can wait but consider contributing now\n\n**2024 limits:**\n- 401(k): $23,000 ($30,500 if over 50)\n- IRA: $7,000 ($8,000 if over 50)\n- HSA: $4,150 individual, $8,300 family\n\n### 2. Review Health Insurance for Next Year\n\n**Open enrollment typically ends mid-December.**\n\n**Review:**\n- Did your health needs change?\n- Are your doctors still in-network?\n- Is there a better plan option?\n- Should you change HSA/FSA contributions?\n\n**FSA reminder:** Use-it-or-lose-it accounts may forfeit unused funds. Spend remaining FSA money on eligible expenses.\n\n### 3. Harvest Tax Losses (If You Invest)\n\nTax-loss harvesting: Selling investments at a loss to offset gains.\n\n**How it works:**\n- Sell investments that have dropped in value\n- Use losses to offset capital gains\n- Can offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income if no gains\n\n**Caution:** Avoid wash sale rule (buying substantially identical security within 30 days).\n\n### 4. Make Charitable Donations\n\nDonations must be made by December 31 for this year's tax deduction.\n\n**If you itemize deductions:**\n- Donate appreciated stock (avoid capital gains)\n- Bunch donations in one year if near standard deduction threshold\n- Keep receipts for all donations\n\n**Even if you do not itemize:** Donations still do good, even without tax benefit.\n\n### 5. Review Your Budget Performance\n\nLook back at the year:\n\n- How did actual spending compare to budget?\n- Which categories were consistently over or under?\n- What unexpected expenses occurred?\n- Did you meet savings goals?\n\n**Use [Pennywise](https://apps.apple.com/si/app/pennywise-finance-tracker/id6754343519) to pull your annual spending summary.**\n\n**What to do with insights:**\n- Adjust next year's budget based on reality\n- Create sinking funds for surprise categories\n- Celebrate what went well\n\n### 6. Check Your Credit Report\n\nFree annual credit reports from all three bureaus at annualcreditreport.com.\n\n**Review for:**\n- Accounts you do not recognize\n- Errors in personal information\n- Late payments incorrectly reported\n- Overall credit health\n\n**Why it matters:** Errors can affect loan rates and applications. Catch them early.\n\n### 7. Update Beneficiaries\n\nLife changes may mean beneficiary designations are outdated.\n\n**Check beneficiaries on:**\n- 401(k) and IRA accounts\n- Life insurance policies\n- Bank accounts (POD/TOD)\n- Any accounts with beneficiary designations\n\n**Common issues:**\n- Ex-spouse still listed\n- Deceased person still listed\n- Children born after accounts opened\n\n### 8. Organize Tax Documents\n\nStart gathering documents now for easier tax filing:\n\n**Income documents:**\n- W-2s (arrive in January)\n- 1099s (investment income, freelance income)\n- Year-end pay stubs\n\n**Deduction documents:**\n- Charitable donation receipts\n- Medical expense records\n- Property tax records\n- Mortgage interest statements\n\n**Create a tax folder** (physical or digital) and add documents as they arrive.\n\n### 9. Calculate Your Net Worth\n\nNet worth = Assets - Liabilities\n\n**Assets:**\n- Bank account balances\n- Investment account values\n- Retirement account values\n- Home equity (if owned)\n- Other valuable assets\n\n**Liabilities:**\n- Credit card balances\n- Student loans\n- Car loans\n- Mortgage balance\n- Other debts\n\n**Track year over year:** Seeing net worth grow (or debt shrink) is motivating.\n\n### 10. Set Financial Goals for Next Year\n\nUse year-end reflection to set next year's goals:\n\n**Good goals are specific:**\n- Save $6,000 to emergency fund\n- Pay off $4,000 credit card balance\n- Increase 401(k) contribution to 15%\n- Track all expenses for the full year\n\n**Write them down. Schedule monthly reviews.**\n\n## Quick Reference Deadlines\n\n| Task | Deadline |\n|------|----------|\n| 401(k) contributions | December 31 |\n| FSA spending | December 31 (or grace period) |\n| Charitable donations | December 31 |\n| Tax-loss harvesting | December 31 |\n| Open enrollment | Usually mid-December |\n| IRA/HSA contributions | April 15 (for prior year) |\n\n## Week-by-Week December Plan\n\n### Week 1 (Dec 1-7)\n\n- [ ] Review health insurance options\n- [ ] Check 401(k) contribution status\n- [ ] Start organizing tax documents\n\n### Week 2 (Dec 8-14)\n\n- [ ] Complete open enrollment decisions\n- [ ] Review investment accounts for tax-loss harvesting\n- [ ] Make charitable donations\n\n### Week 3 (Dec 15-21)\n\n- [ ] Spend remaining FSA funds\n- [ ] Update beneficiaries if needed\n- [ ] Pull annual credit reports\n\n### Week 4 (Dec 22-31)\n\n- [ ] Review annual budget performance\n- [ ] Calculate year-end net worth\n- [ ] Set goals for next year\n- [ ] Ensure any final contributions are made\n\n## Starting Next Year Right\n\nComplete this checklist, and January 1 becomes:\n\n- Tax documents organized\n- Goals clearly set\n- Systems ready to go\n- Insights from last year applied\n\nNo scrambling.
