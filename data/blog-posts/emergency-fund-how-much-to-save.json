  "content": "## What Is an Emergency Fund?\n\nAn emergency fund is money set aside specifically for unexpected expenses or financial emergencies. It is not for vacations, holiday shopping, or that new phone you want. It is for true emergencies: job loss, medical bills, car breakdowns, or home repairs.\n\n## Why You Need One\n\nWithout an emergency fund, unexpected expenses force you into debt. A single financial surprise can trigger a spiral of credit card debt, payday loans, or borrowed money from family. An emergency fund breaks this cycle.\n\n## How Much Should You Save?\n\nThe standard advice is 3-6 months of expenses, but the right amount depends on your situation:\n\n### Minimum: $1,000 Starter Fund\n\nIf you are just starting out or paying off debt, focus on saving $1,000 first. This covers most minor emergencies and stops you from going deeper into debt.\n\n### Standard: 3 Months of Expenses\n\nIf you have a stable job and dual income, 3 months of expenses provides a solid safety net for most emergencies.\n\n### Secure: 6 Months of Expenses\n\nIf you have variable income, work in an unstable industry, are self-employed, or are a single earner household, aim for 6 months.\n\n### How to Calculate Your Number\n\nAdd up your essential monthly expenses:\n- Housing (rent/mortgage, utilities)\n- Food\n- Transportation\n- Insurance\n- Minimum debt payments\n- Other necessities\n\nMultiply by 3 or 6 depending on your situation. This is your target emergency fund.\n\n## Where to Keep Your Emergency Fund\n\nYour emergency fund needs to be:\n- Safe (no risk of loss)\n- Accessible (available within days if needed)\n- Separate (not mixed with checking so you do not accidentally spend it)\n\n### Best Options\n\n**High-Yield Savings Account**\nThe best choice for most people. Earns interest while remaining FDIC insured and accessible within 1-2 business days.\n\n**Money Market Account**\nSimilar to high-yield savings with potentially higher interest rates. May have higher minimum balance requirements.\n\n### Avoid\n\n- Checking accounts (too easy to spend)\n- Cash at home (no interest, risk of theft)\n- Investments (too much risk and not accessible enough)\n- CDs (penalties for early withdrawal)\n\n## How to Build Your Emergency Fund\n\n### Calculate Your Monthly Savings Target\n\nDivide your emergency fund goal by 12 to 24 months. This gives you a realistic monthly savings target.\n\nExample: $6,000 goal / 18 months = $333 per month\n\n### Automate the Savings\n\nSet up automatic transfers from checking to savings. Treat it like a bill that must be paid.\n\n### Track Your Progress in Pennywise\n\nCreate a savings goal in [Pennywise](https://apps.apple.com/si/app/pennywise-finance-tracker/id6754343519) and track your progress. Watching your emergency fund grow is motivating.\n\n### Find Extra Money\n\n- Reduce one expense category\n- Sell items you do not use\n- Put bonuses and tax refunds directly into savings\n- Start a small side income\n\n## When to Use Your Emergency Fund\n\nUse it for:\n- Job loss or significant income reduction\n- Medical emergencies\n- Essential car or home repairs\n- Unexpected necessary travel\n\nDo not use it for:\n- Planned expenses (even if large)\n- Wants disguised as needs\n- Investment opportunities\n- Non-urgent purchases\n\n## Rebuilding After an Emergency\n\nIf you need to use your emergency fund, do not panic. That is what it is for. Once the emergency is handled, make rebuilding the fund a priority before returning to other financial goals.\n\n---\n\n*Start building your emergency fund today.
