Now you are supposed to spend it.\n\nThis is one of the most significant [life stage transitions for your finances](/blog/budgeting-life-stages-complete-guide). This transition is psychologically difficult. Every withdrawal feels like failure. Every expense feels dangerous.\n\nBut you saved this money to use it. Here is how to budget in retirement with confidence.\n\n## Understanding Retirement Income\n\n### Income Sources\n\n**Social Security:**\n- Predictable monthly payment\n- May adjust annually for inflation (COLA)\n- Typically 20-40% of pre-retirement income\n\n**Pension (if applicable):**\n- Fixed monthly payment\n- May or may not have COLA\n- Some pensions reduce after spouse passes\n\n**Retirement account withdrawals:**\n- 401(k), IRA, 403(b)\n- You control the amount\n- Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) start at 73\n\n**Other sources:**\n- Part-time work\n- Rental income\n- Investment dividends\n- Annuities\n\n### The Retirement Income Equation\n\n**Monthly income = Social Security + Pension + Withdrawal from savings + Other**\n\n## How Much Can You Spend?\n\n### The 4% Rule\n\nTraditional guidance: Withdraw 4% of retirement savings in year one, then adjust for inflation.\n\n**Example:**\n- $500,000 saved\n- Year 1 withdrawal: $20,000 (4%)\n- Plus Social Security: $24,000\n- **Annual income: $44,000**\n\n### The 4% Rule Limitations\n\n- Based on 30-year retirement (may live longer)\n- Assumes specific investment mix\n- Does not account for healthcare spikes\n- Market timing matters\n\n### Alternative Approaches\n\n**Dynamic withdrawal:**\n- Spend more in good market years\n- Spend less in down years\n- More complex but more flexible\n\n**Guardrails approach:**\n- Set ceiling and floor for withdrawals\n- Adjust within range based on portfolio performance\n\n**Bucket strategy:**\n- Bucket 1: 1-2 years expenses in cash\n- Bucket 2: 3-10 years in bonds\n- Bucket 3: Remainder in stocks for growth\n\n## Creating Your Retirement Budget\n\n### Step 1: List Guaranteed Income\n\nChoosing the right [budgeting method](/blog/complete-guide-budgeting-methods-2026) makes managing retirement income easier.\n\nIncome that arrives regardless:\n- Social Security\n- Pension\n- Annuity payments\n\n**Example:** $2,800/month guaranteed\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Essential Expenses\n\nMust-pay expenses:\n- Housing (mortgage/rent, taxes, insurance)\n- Utilities\n- Food\n- Healthcare (insurance, medications, copays)\n- Transportation\n- Insurance\n\n**Goal:** Guaranteed income covers essential expenses.\n\n### Step 3: Determine Discretionary Spending\n\nQuality of life expenses:\n- Travel\n- Entertainment\n- Hobbies\n- Dining out\n- Gifts\n- Charitable giving\n\nThis comes from retirement account withdrawals.\n\n### Step 4: Plan for Irregular Expenses\n\n**Annual expenses:**\n- Property taxes (if not escrowed)\n- Insurance premiums\n- Vehicle registration\n\n**Periodic expenses:**\n- Car replacement\n- Home repairs\n- Major medical\n\nDivide annual costs by 12 and include in monthly budget.\n\n## Sample Retirement Budget\n\n**Guaranteed income:** $3,200/month (Social Security + small pension)\n**Planned withdrawal:** $1,500/month (4% rule from $450,000)\n**Total monthly income:** $4,700\n\n| Category | Amount | Notes |\n|----------|--------|-------|\n| Housing | $1,100 | Paid-off home, taxes + insurance |\n| Utilities | $200 | |\n| Groceries | $400 | |\n| Healthcare | $600 | Medicare + supplement + Rx |\n| Transportation | $300 | Insurance, gas, maintenance |\n| Phone/internet | $100 | |\n| **Essential total** | **$2,700** | Covered by guaranteed income |\n| | | |\n| Travel | $400 | Annual trips budgeted monthly |\n| Entertainment | $200 | |\n| Dining out | $200 | |\n| Hobbies | $150 | |\n| Gifts | $100 | |\n| Home maintenance | $200 | Sinking fund |\n| Car replacement | $150 | Sinking fund |\n| Medical reserve | $200 | For uncovered expenses |\n| Buffer | $200 | |\n| **Discretionary total** | **$1,800** | From withdrawals |\n| | | |\n| **Total spending** | **$4,500** | $200 buffer remaining |\n\n## Healthcare: The Wild Card\n\n### Medicare Basics\n\n- Part A: Hospital (usually free)\n- Part B: Medical (premium based on income)\n- Part D: Prescription drugs (separate premium)\n- Medigap: Supplemental coverage (optional but recommended)\n\n**Budget $300-600/month for healthcare** depending on coverage choices and health status. Consider setting up [sinking funds](/blog/sinking-fund-categories) for healthcare expenses to spread the cost.\n\n### Long-Term Care\n\nMedicare does not cover long-term care. Options:\n\n- Long-term care insurance (expensive)\n- Self-insure (save specifically for this)\n- Medicaid (requires spending down assets)\n\nPlan for this possibility in your budget.\n\n## Common Retirement Budget Mistakes\n\n### Mistake 1: Underestimating Healthcare\n\nHealthcare costs rise with age. Budget generously and increase over time.\n\n### Mistake 2: Not Adjusting for Inflation\n\nCosts rise. Your withdrawals should too. Review annually.\n\n### Mistake 3: Forgetting Home Maintenance\n\nOlder homes need more work. Budget 1-2% of home value annually.\n\n### Mistake 4: Spending Too Little\n\nSome retirees are so scared of running out that they never enjoy their money. You saved it to use it.\n\n### Mistake 5: Spending Too Much Early\n\nRetirement can last 30+ years. Pace yourself.\n\n### Mistake 6: Ignoring Sequence Risk\n\nBig market losses early in retirement hurt more than losses later. Keep 1-2 years expenses in cash.\n\n## Retirement Spending Phases\n\n### Go-Go Years (65-75)\n\nMost active years. Higher discretionary spending:\n- Travel\n- Activities\n- Hobbies\n- Helping family\n\nBudget may be higher than later years.\n\n### Slow-Go Years (75-85)\n\nActivity decreases. Spending often decreases:\n- Less travel\n- More time at home\n- Lower transportation costs\n\n### No-Go Years (85+)\n\nActivity limited. But healthcare may spike:\n- Less discretionary spending\n- Higher medical costs\n- Possible care needs\n\nPlan for spending to shift, not just decrease.\n\n## Tax Considerations\n\n### Withdrawal Sequencing\n\nWithdraw from accounts in tax-efficient order:\n\n1. Taxable accounts (may have lower tax rates)\n2. Tax-deferred accounts (401k, traditional IRA)\n3. Tax-free accounts (Roth IRA) - save for last or emergencies\n\n### Required Minimum Distributions\n\nStarting at age 73:\n- Must withdraw minimum amounts from tax-deferred accounts\n- Counts as taxable income\n- Penalties for not taking RMDs\n\nPlan budget around RMD requirements.\n\n### Tax Bracket Management\n\nStrategic withdrawals can keep you in lower tax brackets:\n- Convert some traditional to Roth in low-income years\n- Time capital gains for lower-income years\n- Consider tax impact of Social Security (up to 85% taxable)\n\n## Tracking Retirement Spending\n\nUse [Pennywise](https://apps.apple.com/si/app/pennywise-finance-tracker/id6754343519) to:\n\n- Track actual spending against budget\n- Monitor spending trends over time\n- Catch budget creep early\n- Adjust categories as needs change\n\n## Annual Retirement Budget Review\n\nEach year, review and adjust:\n\n1. **Income:** Did Social Security change? Investment performance?\n2. **Healthcare:** Premium changes? Coverage needs?\n3. **Inflation:** Increase budget categories appropriately\n4. **Lifestyle:** Any changes in needs or wants?\n5. **Portfolio:** Adjust withdrawal rate if needed\n\n## The Permission to Spend\n\nYou worked hard. You saved diligently. You earned this money.\n\nRetirement is not about hoarding. It is about enjoying the life you built.\n\n- Travel while you can\n- Pursue hobbies you delayed\n- Help family if you want to\n- Give to causes you care about\n- Live, do not just exist\n\nA budget gives you permission to spend guilt-free because you know the math works.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nRetirement budgeting means:\n\n1. Knowing your income sources\n2. Covering essentials with guaranteed income\n3. Funding lifestyle with strategic withdrawals\n4. Planning for healthcare increases\n5. Adjusting annually\n6.
