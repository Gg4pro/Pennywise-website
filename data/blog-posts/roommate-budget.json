But sharing expenses with people who are not family or romantic partners requires clear systems.\n\nWithout them, you get passive-aggressive notes about electricity usage, awkward Venmo requests, and resentment that destroys living situations.\n\n## Splitting Rent: Three Methods\n\n### Method 1: Equal Split\n\nTotal rent divided by number of roommates. Simple.\n\n**Example:** $2,400 rent / 3 roommates = $800 each\n\n**Works when:**\n- Bedrooms are similar size\n- Shared spaces are equally used\n- No significant amenity differences\n\n**Problems when:**\n- One room is much larger\n- One room has private bathroom\n- One room has better features (window, closet)\n\n### Method 2: Square Footage Split\n\nRent proportional to each person's private space.\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Measure each bedroom's square footage\n2. Calculate each room's percentage of total private space\n3. Apply percentage to rent\n\n**Example:**\n- Room A: 150 sq ft (37.5%)\n- Room B: 130 sq ft (32.5%)\n- Room C: 120 sq ft (30%)\n- Total: 400 sq ft\n\n**$2,400 rent split:**\n- Room A: $900\n- Room B: $780\n- Room C: $720\n\n**Works when:**\n- Significant size differences exist\n- Rooms are otherwise similar\n- Roommates agree size is main differentiator\n\n### Method 3: Feature-Based Adjustment\n\nStart with equal split, then adjust for features.\n\n**Typical adjustments:**\n- Larger room: +$50-100\n- Private bathroom: +$50-100\n- Better window/view: +$25-50\n- Walk-in closet: +$25-50\n- Parking space: +$50-100\n\n**Example:**\n- Base rent: $800 each\n- Room A (largest, private bath): $800 + $100 + $75 = $975\n- Room B (medium, shared bath): $800 + $25 = $825\n- Room C (smallest, shared bath): $800 - $125 = $675\n- Total: $2,475 (adjust if needed to hit $2,400)\n\n**Works when:**\n- Multiple factors affect room desirability\n- Roommates have different priorities\n\n## Splitting Utilities\n\n### Equal Split (Most Common)\n\nTotal utilities divided equally.\n\n**Works because:**\n- Simple to calculate\n- Shared spaces benefit everyone\n- Individual usage is hard to track precisely\n\n### Usage-Based Adjustments\n\nConsider adjustments when:\n\n**One person works from home:** Increased daytime electricity and internet usage. Maybe they pay an extra $20-30/month.\n\n**One person has high electricity use:** Window AC unit, space heater, mining rig. Their electricity-heavy items should cost them more.\n\n**One person never home:** If someone travels frequently for work, they might pay slightly less.\n\n### What to Include\n\n**Always split:**\n- Electricity\n- Gas/heating\n- Water (if not included in rent)\n- Internet\n- Trash\n\n**Maybe split:**\n- Streaming services (if shared)\n- Cleaning supplies\n- Toilet paper and paper towels\n\n**Usually individual:**\n- Phone plans\n- Personal subscriptions\n- Renter's insurance\n\n## Shared Household Expenses\n\n### The Shared Fund Approach\n\nCreate a shared expense fund for communal purchases.\n\n**Each roommate contributes:** $30-50/month to shared fund\n\n**Fund covers:**\n- Cleaning supplies\n- Paper products\n- Basic kitchen staples (oil, spices)\n- Light bulbs\n- Shared household items\n\n**Advantages:**\n- No tracking individual purchases\n- Always a fund for needs\n- Reduces nickel-and-diming\n\n### The Rotation Approach\n\nRoommates take turns buying shared supplies.\n\n**Example:**\n- Month 1: Person A buys toilet paper and cleaning supplies\n- Month 2: Person B's turn\n- Month 3: Person C's turn\n\n**Advantages:**\n- No shared fund to manage\n- Everyone contributes\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n- Uneven spending possible\n- Requires trust\n\n### The Split Everything Approach\n\nTrack every shared purchase. Split costs.\n\n**Tools:** Splitwise, spreadsheet, Venmo requests\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Precise fairness\n- Clear accountability\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n- High effort\n- Can feel petty\n- Requires consistent tracking\n\n## Food: The Tricky Category\n\n### Option 1: Completely Separate\n\nEach person buys their own food. Clearly label in fridge. Do not touch others' food.\n\n**Works for:** Roommates with different diets, budgets, or who rarely cook together.\n\n### Option 2: Shared Staples\n\nBasics are shared (milk, bread, butter, eggs). Meals are individual.\n\n**Shared fund or rotation handles staples.** Personal groceries are personal.\n\n### Option 3: Fully Shared\n\nAll food is communal. Everyone contributes equally.\n\n**Works for:** Close friends, similar eating habits, people who cook together.\n\n**Requires:** Trust that contributions are roughly equal.\n\n### Option 4: Hybrid\n\nMost food is individual. Occasional shared meals split at time of purchase.\n\n\"I am making dinner, want to split ingredients?\" approach.\n\n## Tracking Shared Expenses\n\n### Use an App\n\n**Splitwise** is popular for roommates:\n- Log shared expenses\n- App calculates who owes whom\n- Settle up periodically\n\n### Shared Spreadsheet\n\nGoogle Sheet with columns:\n- Date\n- Who paid\n- Amount\n- What for\n- Running balances\n\n### Personal Tracking\n\nUse [Pennywise](https://apps.apple.com/si/app/pennywise-finance-tracker/id6754343519) to track your personal expenses and your share of roommate costs.\n\n## The Roommate Agreement\n\nBefore moving in together, agree in writing:\n\n### Financial Terms\n\n- How is rent split?\n- How are utilities split?\n- When is rent due to landlord? To each other?\n- How are shared expenses handled?\n- What is each person's share?\n\n### Payment Logistics\n\n- Who pays the landlord/utility companies?\n- How do others pay their share to that person?\n- What is the deadline each month?\n- Late payment consequences?\n\n### Food and Supplies\n\n- Shared or separate food?\n- How are communal supplies handled?\n- Labeled shelves in fridge?\n\n### Other Considerations\n\n- Guests and their resource usage\n- Cleaning responsibilities\n- Quiet hours\n- What happens if someone wants to leave early?\n\n## Common Roommate Money Problems\n\n### Problem 1: Late Payments\n\n**Solution:** Set clear due dates. Person paying bills should not have to cover others. Build in buffer days.\n\n### Problem 2: Unequal Usage Claims\n\n\"I should pay less utilities because I am never home.\"\n\n**Solution:** Unless extreme (someone gone 3 weeks/month), equal split is simplest. Tracking individual usage creates resentment.\n\n### Problem 3: Different Standards\n\nOne roommate wants premium everything. Others want budget.\n\n**Solution:** Agree on standard level. Premium preferences are paid by the person who wants them.\n\n### Problem 4: The Disappearing Supplies\n\nShared supplies vanish faster than expected.\n\n**Solution:** Either accept it, switch to individual supplies, or have a direct conversation.\n\n### Problem 5: Boyfriend/Girlfriend Who Never Leaves\n\nPartner is there 5+ nights per week.\n\n**Solution:** Address it directly. They should contribute to utilities if essentially living there. Not fair to other roommates.\n\n## Sample Roommate Budget\n\n**Three roommates, $3,000/month apartment:**\n\n| Expense | Total | Per Person |\n|---------|-------|------------|\n| Rent | $3,000 | $1,000 |\n| Electricity | $150 | $50 |\n| Internet | $75 | $25 |\n| Shared supplies fund | $90 | $30 |\n| **Total** | **$3,315** | **$1,105** |\n\n**Each person budgets:** $1,105/month for shared living costs plus their personal expenses.\n\n## Making It Work\n\n### Communicate Early\n\nAddress issues when small. \"Hey, I noticed the electricity bill jumped. Any idea why?\" is easier than months of resentment.\n\n### Be Flexible\n\nLife happens. If a roommate has a rough month, work with them. You might need the same grace someday.\n\n### Keep It Business-Like\n\nFriendship and finances can coexist if you treat the financial part professionally. Clear agreements, timely payments, direct communication.\n\n### Review Periodically\n\nEvery few months, check in. Is the system working? Any adjustments needed?\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nRoommates save money when the financial system works. When it does not work, it costs relationships.\n\nSet clear agreements upfront. Use simple tracking. Communicate issues early. Pay on time.\n\nThe goal is for money to be the easy part of living together.\n\n---\n\n*Track your share of roommate expenses with Pennywise.
