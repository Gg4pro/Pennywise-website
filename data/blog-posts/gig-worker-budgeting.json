  "content": "## The Gig Work Money Problem\n\nGig work sounds like freedom: work when you want, be your own boss, flexible hours.\n\nThe financial reality is more complicated:\n- Income varies weekly or daily\n- You pay both halves of Social Security and Medicare\n- Expenses eat into earnings\n- No employer handles taxes or benefits\n- Apps show gross earnings, not real profit\n\nWithout proper planning, gig work can leave you worse off than a regular job paying less per hour.\n\n## Understanding Your Real Earnings\n\nThe number on your app is not what you actually earn.\n\n### What the App Shows\n\nUber, DoorDash, or other platforms display gross earnings. This week you made $800. Sounds good.\n\n### What You Actually Earned\n\n**$800 gross earnings**\n\nMinus expenses:\n- Gas: $100\n- Maintenance/wear: $50\n- Phone data: $15\n- Supplies (bags, cleaners): $10\n- **Expenses total: $175**\n\n**Net before taxes: $625**\n\nMinus taxes (estimated 25%):\n- **Tax obligation: $156**\n\n**Actual earnings: $469**\n\nThat $800 was really $469 after expenses and taxes. Many gig workers never do this math and end up underwater.\n\n### Calculate Your True Hourly Rate\n\n**Formula:** (Gross - Expenses - Taxes) / Hours worked = True hourly rate\n\n**Example:**\n- Gross: $800\n- Expenses: $175\n- Taxes: $156\n- Net: $469\n- Hours worked: 30\n- **True hourly rate: $15.63**\n\nIs that better than a job with benefits? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Know your number.\n\n## Track Everything\n\nGig work requires meticulous tracking.\n\n### Income Tracking\n\nLog every payment from every platform:\n- Date\n- Platform\n- Gross amount\n- Tips included\n\n### Expense Tracking\n\nTrack every work-related expense:\n- Gas (date, amount, odometer)\n- Maintenance (every service, repair)\n- Supplies\n- Phone/data used for work\n- Hot bags, car accessories\n- Platform fees (if any)\n\n### Mileage Tracking\n\nMileage is your biggest tax deduction. Options:\n- Apps like Stride, Everlance, or MileIQ\n- Paper logbook\n- Start/end odometer for each shift\n\n**Do not estimate.** IRS requires contemporaneous records. Track every work mile.\n\n### Use the Right Tools\n\n[Pennywise](https://apps.apple.com/si/app/pennywise-finance-tracker/id6754343519) helps track income and personal expenses. For gig-specific tracking, pair it with a mileage app.\n\n## The Gig Worker Tax Reality\n\n### Self-Employment Tax\n\nAs a gig worker, you pay self-employment tax: 15.3% on net earnings.\n\n- Social Security: 12.4%\n- Medicare: 2.9%\n\nEmployees split this with employers. You pay both halves.\n\n### Income Tax\n\nOn top of self-employment tax, you pay regular federal and state income tax on your net earnings.\n\n### Combined Tax Burden\n\nExpect to owe 20-35% of net earnings depending on your total income and state.\n\n**Example:**\n- Net earnings: $30,000\n- Self-employment tax: $4,590\n- Federal income tax (estimated): $2,500\n- State income tax (varies): $1,000\n- **Total: $8,090 (27%)**\n\n### Quarterly Payments\n\nThe IRS expects taxes paid throughout the year, not in one April lump sum.\n\n**Due dates:**\n- Q1 (Jan-Mar): April 15\n- Q2 (Apr-May): June 15\n- Q3 (Jun-Aug): September 15\n- Q4 (Sep-Dec): January 15\n\nMiss quarterly payments and you owe penalties plus interest.\n\n## The Gig Worker Budget System\n\n### Step 1: Determine Your Baseline\n\nCalculate minimum monthly expenses:\n- Rent/housing\n- Utilities\n- Groceries (basic)\n- Insurance\n- Phone\n- Minimum debt payments\n- Car payment (if any)\n\nThis is survival mode. You must cover this every month.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Required Gross Earnings\n\nWork backwards from baseline:\n\n**Baseline expenses:** $2,500\n**Plus savings goal:** $250\n**Plus taxes (30%):** $1,179\n**Plus work expenses (20%):** $786\n**Required gross earnings:** $4,715/month\n\n### Step 3: Set Minimum Hours/Earnings Targets\n\nIf you average $20/hour gross:\n$4,715 / $20 = 236 hours/month or about 59 hours/week\n\nIf you average $25/hour gross:\n$4,715 / $25 = 189 hours/month or about 47 hours/week\n\nKnow your minimum targets.\n\n### Step 4: Create the Money Flow System\n\nWhen payments arrive:\n\n1. **Taxes (30%)** → Tax savings account (do not touch)\n2. **Work expenses (20%)** → Business account for gas, maintenance\n3. **Remaining (50%)** → Personal account for living expenses\n\n### Step 5: Weekly Budgeting\n\nGig income varies too much for monthly budgeting. Think weekly:\n\n- Review earnings each Sunday\n- Allocate percentages immediately\n- Know if you are on track for monthly targets\n- Adjust next week's hours if needed\n\n## Managing Variable Income\n\n### Build a Buffer\n\nSave at least one month of baseline expenses in an accessible buffer account. This smooths out slow weeks.\n\n**Building the buffer:**\n- During good weeks, send extra to buffer\n- Draw from buffer during slow weeks\n- Replenish immediately when income improves\n\n### Know Your Patterns\n\nGig work has predictable patterns:\n- Weekends usually busier\n- Holidays can be feast or famine\n- Weather affects driving gigs\n- Seasonal fluctuations exist\n\nAnticipate slow periods and save during busy ones.\n\n### Minimum Income Rule\n\nSet a weekly minimum. Do not stop working until you hit it.\n\n**Example:** Weekly minimum gross = $1,200\n\nIf you are at $800 by Friday evening, work Saturday. If you are at $1,300 by Thursday, take Friday off if you want.\n\n## Deductions That Save Money\n\n### Standard Mileage Rate\n\nIn 2024, deduct 67 cents per business mile. This is usually better than tracking actual vehicle expenses.\n\n**Example:**\n- Drove 1,500 miles for gig work this month\n- Deduction: 1,500 x $0.67 = $1,005\n\nOn $3,000 gross income, this significantly reduces taxable income.\n\n### Other Deductions\n\n- Phone used for work (percentage)\n- Hot bags and delivery supplies\n- Tolls and parking for work\n- Platform fees\n- Car washes (if needed for rideshare)\n- Background check fees\n- Professional services (tax prep)\n\n### Qualified Business Income Deduction\n\nYou may qualify for a 20% deduction on qualified business income. Consult a tax professional.\n\n## Common Gig Worker Mistakes\n\n### Mistake 1: No Tax Savings\n\nSpending gross income and hoping to pay taxes later never works. Set aside taxes immediately.\n\n### Mistake 2: Ignoring Expenses\n\nPretending expenses do not exist inflates perceived earnings. Track real profit.\n\n### Mistake 3: No Mileage Log\n\nMileage is your biggest deduction. Without records, you cannot claim it. Track every mile.\n\n### Mistake 4: Working Only Peak Hours\n\nPeak hours pay more, but chasing only peaks means inconsistent income. Balance peak earnings with baseline consistency.\n\n### Mistake 5: No Buffer\n\nOne slow week should not cause a financial crisis. Build your buffer.\n\n### Mistake 6: Not Treating It Like a Business\n\nGig work is self-employment. Treat it with business discipline: tracking, budgeting, tax planning.\n\n## Should You Do Gig Work?\n\n### Gig Work Makes Sense If:\n\n- Your true hourly rate (after expenses, taxes) exceeds alternatives\n- You value flexibility over stability\n- You have other income and this supplements\n- You have low transportation costs (efficient car, EV, bike)\n- You can work peak hours consistently\n\n### Reconsider If:\n\n- Your true hourly rate is below minimum wage\n- You are financing an expensive car for gig work\n- You have no other income or safety net\n- You cannot handle income variability\n- You are not tracking expenses and taxes\n\n## Sample Gig Worker Budget\n\n**Weekly gross earnings target: $1,200**\n\n**Immediate allocations:**\n- Taxes (30%): $360\n- Work expenses (20%): $240\n- Personal: $600\n\n**Monthly personal budget ($2,400):**\n- Rent: $1,100\n- Utilities: $100\n- Groceries: $300\n- Car payment: $250\n- Car insurance: $150\n- Phone: $60\n- Health insurance: $200\n- Savings: $200\n- Everything else: $40\n\nTight but doable. Higher earnings provide more breathing room.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nGig work can provide good income and flexibility, but only with proper financial management.\n\nKnow your real earnings. Track everything. Set aside taxes immediately. Build a buffer. Treat it like a business.\n\nThe difference between struggling gig workers and successful ones is not luck. It is systems.\n\n---\n\n*Managing gig income? Download Pennywise to track your earnings and personal expenses in one place.*"
