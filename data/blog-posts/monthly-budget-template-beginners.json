  "content": "## Your First Budget Does Not Need to Be Perfect\n\nMany people never start budgeting because they think it needs to be complicated. They imagine spreadsheets with dozens of categories, hours of data entry, and complex calculations. The truth? A simple budget you actually follow beats a complex one you abandon.\n\n## The 5-Category Budget Template\n\nFor beginners, we recommend starting with just five categories:\n\n### 1. Housing (30-35% of income)\n\nThis includes:\n- Rent or mortgage payment\n- Utilities (electricity, water, gas, internet)\n- Renters or homeowners insurance\n- Basic home maintenance\n\n### 2. Transportation (10-15% of income)\n\nThis includes:\n- Car payment (if any)\n- Gas or public transit\n- Car insurance\n- Parking and tolls\n- Basic maintenance\n\n### 3. Food (10-15% of income)\n\nThis includes:\n- Groceries\n- Dining out\n- Coffee shops\n- Work lunches\n\n### 4. Personal and Entertainment (10-20% of income)\n\nThis includes:\n- Clothing\n- Entertainment and subscriptions\n- Personal care\n- Hobbies\n- Gifts\n\n### 5. Savings and Debt (20-30% of income)\n\nThis includes:\n- Emergency fund contributions\n- Retirement savings\n- Extra debt payments\n- Other savings goals\n\n## How to Create Your Budget in 30 Minutes\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Your Monthly Income (5 minutes)\n\nWrite down your take-home pay (after taxes). If your income varies, use an average of the last 3 months.\n\n### Step 2: List Your Fixed Expenses (10 minutes)\n\nThese are expenses that stay the same every month: rent, insurance, subscriptions, loan payments. Add them up.\n\n### Step 3: Estimate Your Variable Expenses (10 minutes)\n\nLook at your bank statements for the last month. How much did you spend on groceries? Gas? Dining out? Entertainment? Make your best estimates.\n\n### Step 4: Compare Income to Expenses (5 minutes)\n\nIncome minus expenses should equal zero or a positive number. If it is negative, you need to cut expenses or increase income.\n\n## Setting Up Your Budget in Pennywise\n\n[Pennywise](https://apps.apple.com/si/app/pennywise-finance-tracker/id6754343519) makes it easy to track against your budget:\n\n1. Open Pennywise and go to Categories\n2. Create your 5 main categories\n3. Set a monthly target for each category\n4. Log expenses as you make them\n5. Check your progress weekly\n\n## Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid\n\n**Mistake 1: Making it too complicated**\nStart with 5 categories. You can add more later once tracking becomes a habit.\n\n**Mistake 2: Forgetting irregular expenses**\nCar registration, annual subscriptions, and holiday gifts happen every year. Budget for them monthly.\n\n**Mistake 3: No buffer for mistakes**\nLeave a small \"miscellaneous\" buffer. You will forget something or underestimate something every month.\n\n**Mistake 4: Giving up after one bad month**\nOne month of overspending does not mean your budget failed. Review, adjust, and try again.\n\n## Your Monthly Budget Checklist\n\nAt the start of each month:\n- Review last month's spending\n- Adjust category targets if needed\n- Set one specific improvement goal\n\nThroughout the month:\n- Log expenses daily (takes 30 seconds)\n- Check progress weekly\n- Adjust spending if you are trending over budget\n\n---\n\n*Ready to start your budget?
