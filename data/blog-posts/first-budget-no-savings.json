Most Americans have less than $1,000 in savings. You are not uniquely bad with money. You just have not had the right system yet.\n\nThis guide walks you through creating your first budget when you are starting with nothing.\n\n## Why You Have No Savings (And Why It Is Not Your Fault)\n\nBefore we fix the problem, understand why it exists:\n\n**Wages have not kept up with costs.** Housing, healthcare, and education have outpaced income growth for decades.\n\n**Financial education is rare.** Schools do not teach budgeting. Most people learn money habits from parents who also never learned.\n\n**Everything is designed to make you spend.** Marketing, easy credit, one-click purchasing: billions of dollars are spent figuring out how to separate you from your money.\n\n**Emergencies happen.** Without savings, every unexpected expense becomes debt, which makes saving harder, which means the next emergency becomes more debt.\n\nYou are not broken. The system is stacked against you. But you can still win.\n\n## Step 1: Know Your Actual Numbers\n\nYou cannot budget without knowing what you earn and spend. Many people avoid this step because the truth is uncomfortable.\n\n### Calculate Your Monthly Income\n\nAdd up all money that comes in:\n- Paychecks (net, after taxes)\n- Side hustle income\n- Government benefits\n- Child support/alimony\n- Any other regular income\n\n**Important:** Use realistic numbers. If your side hustle varies, use the lowest typical amount.\n\n### Calculate Your Current Spending\n\nPull the last three months of bank and credit card statements. Categorize every transaction:\n\n- Housing (rent, mortgage)\n- Utilities (electric, gas, water, internet, phone)\n- Food (groceries AND dining out)\n- Transportation (car payment, insurance, gas, transit)\n- Insurance (health, life, other)\n- Debt payments (credit cards, loans)\n- Subscriptions (streaming, gym, apps)\n- Personal (clothing, haircuts, toiletries)\n- Entertainment (going out, hobbies)\n- Everything else\n\nThis is painful but essential. You need to see where money actually goes, not where you think it goes.\n\n### Face the Gap\n\nIncome minus spending = your current savings rate.\n\nIf this number is negative, you are going into debt each month. If it is zero, you are barely breaking even. If it is small but positive, you have something to work with.\n\n## Step 2: Find Your Baseline\n\nYour baseline is the absolute minimum needed to survive. This is not your goal budget. It is your emergency floor.\n\n**Baseline includes only:**\n- Rent or mortgage\n- Basic utilities\n- Groceries (minimal, not dining out)\n- Transportation to work\n- Required insurance\n- Minimum debt payments\n- Essential medications\n\n**Baseline excludes:**\n- Dining out\n- Entertainment\n- Subscriptions\n- Shopping\n- Anything you could live without for a month\n\nKnowing your baseline serves two purposes:\n1. It shows what you must earn to survive\n2. It reveals how much is technically available for saving\n\n## Step 3: Create a Starter Budget\n\nYour first budget does not need to be perfect. It needs to be realistic and achievable.\n\n### The Starter Framework\n\n**Essentials First (cover these before anything else):**\n- Housing: Your actual rent/mortgage\n- Utilities: Actual amounts\n- Food: Realistic grocery budget\n- Transportation: What you actually spend\n- Insurance: Required coverage\n- Minimum debt payments: Required amounts\n\n**Small Savings (yes, even now):**\n- Start with $25-50 per paycheck\n- This is non-negotiable\n- Treat it like a bill\n\n**Reduced Wants (not eliminated):**\n- Dining out: Cut in half from current\n- Entertainment: Set a small, specific amount\n- Subscriptions: Keep only what you use weekly\n\n### Sample Starter Budget\n\n**Income: $3,200/month**\n\n| Category | Amount |\n|----------|--------|\n| Rent | $1,100 |\n| Utilities | $150 |\n| Phone | $60 |\n| Groceries | $350 |\n| Transportation | $300 |\n| Insurance | $150 |\n| Minimum debt | $200 |\n| **Essential total** | **$2,310** |\n| Dining out | $100 |\n| Entertainment | $50 |\n| Subscriptions | $30 |\n| Personal | $50 |\n| **Wants total** | **$230** |\n| Emergency fund | $50 |\n| Buffer/misc | $50 |\n| **Savings total** | **$100** |\n| **Remaining** | **$560** |\n\nThat remaining $560 goes to additional debt payoff or savings.\n\n## Step 4: Start Your Emergency Fund\n\nYour first savings goal is a starter emergency fund: $1,000.\n\nThis small cushion prevents minor emergencies from becoming debt. A flat tire should not require a credit card.\n\n### Why $1,000 First\n\n- Covers most small emergencies\n- Achievable in a few months\n- Builds saving habit and confidence\n- Provides psychological security\n\n### Where to Keep It\n\nOpen a separate savings account. Not linked to checking for easy transfer. Out of sight reduces temptation.\n\nHigh-yield savings accounts earn more interest, but any separate account works.\n\n### How to Fund It\n\n**Automatic transfers:** Set up $25-100 per paycheck, automatically transferred to savings.\n\n**Found money:** Tax refunds, gifts, rebates, sold items: send directly to savings.\n\n**Spending cuts:** Cancel one subscription. Reduce dining out. Temporary sacrifices for permanent security.\n\n**Extra income:** Side gig, overtime, selling unused items.\n\n## Step 5: Track Everything\n\nA budget only works if you follow it. Following it requires knowing where you stand.\n\n### Daily Habit\n\nLog every expense. Use [Pennywise](https://apps.apple.com/si/app/pennywise-finance-tracker/id6754343519) on your phone. Takes 10 seconds per transaction.\n\nThe act of logging makes you think twice about spending.\n\n### Weekly Check-In\n\nEvery Sunday, spend 10 minutes:\n- How much have you spent this week?\n- Are any categories running over?\n- What is coming up next week?\n\n### Monthly Review\n\nAt month end:\n- Did you hit your savings target?\n- Which categories were over/under?\n- What needs to change next month?\n\n## Step 6: Increase Income (When Possible)\n\nBudgeting can only do so much. At some point, you need more money coming in.\n\n### Immediate Options\n\n- Ask for overtime\n- Sell unused items (Facebook Marketplace, eBay)\n- Gig work (DoorDash, TaskRabbit, Instacart)\n- Freelance your skills\n- Reduce work commute costs (more take-home pay)\n\n### Medium-Term Options\n\n- Ask for a raise (with documented justification)\n- Apply for higher-paying jobs\n- Add certifications that increase value\n- Start a side business\n\n### Long-Term Options\n\n- Education or training for career change\n- Move to lower cost of living area\n- Build passive income streams\n\n## Common First-Budget Mistakes\n\n### Mistake 1: Being Too Aggressive\n\nCutting everything to zero does not work. You will burn out and binge spend. Allow small amounts for enjoyment.\n\n### Mistake 2: Not Including Irregular Expenses\n\nCar registration, holiday gifts, annual subscriptions: divide annual costs by 12 and budget monthly.\n\n### Mistake 3: Giving Up After One Bad Month\n\nYou will overspend some months. You will have unexpected expenses. One bad month does not erase progress. Adjust and continue.\n\n### Mistake 4: Not Tracking\n\nA budget you do not track is just a wish. Logging expenses is essential.\n\n### Mistake 5: Keeping Credit Cards Accessible\n\nWhile building savings, credit cards are emergency temptation. Remove from wallet. Delete from online accounts.\n\n## What Success Looks Like\n\n### Month 1-2\n- Budget created\n- Tracking habit established\n- Saved $50-100\n- Found one expense to cut\n\n### Month 3-4\n- Emergency fund at $300-500\n- Categories more accurate\n- Spending more intentional\n- Less financial anxiety\n\n### Month 5-6\n- Emergency fund at $1,000\n- Budget feels natural\n- Unexpected expenses do not cause panic\n- Ready to tackle bigger goals\n\n## After $1,000: What Next?\n\nOnce your starter emergency fund is complete:\n\n1. **Attack high-interest debt.** Anything over 8-10% interest gets aggressive payments.\n\n2. **Expand emergency fund.** Build toward one month of expenses, then three months.\n\n3. **Start retirement savings.** Even small amounts in a 401(k) or IRA compound significantly over time.\n\n4. **Set additional goals.** Car replacement, vacation, house down payment: specific goals drive motivation.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nStarting from zero is the hardest point. Every dollar saved is harder to find when you have none.\n\nBut it gets easier. Once you have $100 saved, adding another $100 is less painful. Once you have $1,000, unexpected expenses do not derail you.\n\nThe first budget, the first savings deposit, the first month of tracking: these are the hardest steps. Take them anyway.\n\nYour future self is depending on you.\n\n---\n\n*Ready to start your first budget? Download Pennywise and take the first step toward financial security.*"
