You will get through this.\n- Do not make any major financial decisions yet.\n- Write down what you know about your situation.\n\n**Second day:**\n- Begin systematic assessment (this guide).\n- File for unemployment benefits immediately.\n- Review what you have.\n\n## Step 1: Assess Your Situation\n\n### What Money Do You Have?\n\n**Calculate liquid resources:**\n- Checking account balance\n- Savings account balance\n- Emergency fund\n- Any severance payment coming\n- Unused vacation payout\n- Any money owed to you\n\n**Total available cash: $________**\n\n### What Are Your Monthly Expenses?\n\n**Essential (must pay):**\n- Rent/mortgage\n- Utilities (basic)\n- Food (groceries only)\n- Transportation (to job search)\n- Health insurance (COBRA or alternative)\n- Phone (basic plan)\n- Minimum debt payments\n- Essential medications\n\n**Non-essential (can cut):**\n- Dining out\n- Entertainment\n- Subscriptions\n- Shopping\n- Anything discretionary\n\n**Monthly essential expenses: $________**\n\n### How Long Can You Survive?\n\n**Runway = Total cash / Monthly essentials**\n\nExample: $12,000 cash / $3,000 essentials = 4 months runway\n\nThis is your planning horizon.\n\n## Step 2: Maximize Income\n\n### File for Unemployment Immediately\n\nUnemployment benefits replace portion of income. Every state is different.\n\n**Do this today:**\n- Visit your state unemployment website\n- File your initial claim\n- Keep records of everything\n\n**Benefits typically:**\n- Replace 40-60% of income up to state maximum\n- Last 13-26 weeks depending on state\n- Require active job search\n\n### Severance and Final Pay\n\n**Check with former employer:**\n- Severance package?\n- Unused vacation/PTO payout?\n- Bonus proration?\n- When is final paycheck?\n- How long does health insurance continue?\n\n### Other Income Sources\n\n**Immediate options:**\n- Gig work (DoorDash, Instacart, TaskRabbit)\n- Freelance your skills\n- Selling unused items\n- Part-time work while searching\n\n**Apply for assistance if eligible:**\n- SNAP (food stamps)\n- Medicaid (health insurance)\n- Utility assistance (LIHEAP)\n- Local emergency assistance programs\n\n## Step 3: Cut to Essential Spending\n\nThis is not the time for half-measures. Cut deep and fast.\n\n### Cancel Immediately\n\n- Streaming services (all of them)\n- Gym membership (walk outside)\n- Subscription boxes\n- Premium app subscriptions\n- Anything auto-renewing you can pause\n\n### Reduce Drastically\n\n- Dining out: $0 budget\n- Entertainment: Free options only\n- Shopping: Needs only, no wants\n- Groceries: Strategic, basic items\n\n### Negotiate Bills\n\n**Call every company:**\n- Internet: Request lower plan or hardship discount\n- Phone: Downgrade to minimum plan\n- Insurance: Review coverage levels\n- Credit cards: Request hardship programs\n- Landlord: Communicate proactively\n\nMany companies have hardship programs. You have to ask.\n\n## Step 4: Protect Essentials\n\n### Housing Priority\n\nLosing housing makes job searching much harder.\n\n**If struggling with rent:**\n- Communicate with landlord early\n- Research local rental assistance programs\n- Understand eviction laws (you have rights)\n- Consider roommates or moving\n\n### Health Insurance\n\n**Options after employer coverage ends:**\n- COBRA: Expensive but continuous coverage\n- Marketplace (ACA): May qualify for subsidies\n- Medicaid: If income qualifies\n- Short-term health insurance: Temporary bridge\n\nDo not go uninsured. One medical emergency can destroy finances.\n\n### Debt Management\n\n**Talk to creditors immediately:**\n- Credit cards often have hardship programs\n- Student loans have deferment/forbearance options\n- Many lenders have unemployment policies\n\nWorst thing: Ignore payments and hope.\nBest thing: Contact creditors proactively.\n\n## Step 5: Create Unemployment Budget\n\n### Sample Budget: Job Loss Mode\n\n**Income:**\n- Unemployment benefits: $1,800/month\n- Gig work: $400/month\n- **Total: $2,200/month**\n\n**Expenses:**\n- Rent: $1,200\n- Utilities: $100\n- Groceries: $250\n- Transportation: $100\n- Health insurance (Marketplace): $150\n- Phone: $35\n- Minimum debt payments: $200\n- **Total: $2,035**\n\n**Remaining: $165** (cushion for unexpected)\n\n### Track Everything\n\nUse [Pennywise](https://apps.apple.com/si/app/pennywise-finance-tracker/id6754343519) to track every expense during unemployment. You cannot afford surprises.\n\n## Step 6: Job Search Strategy\n\n### Prioritize Income, Not Perfect Job\n\nYour first priority is cash flow. A job that is okay now is better than a perfect job in six months.\n\n**Strategy:**\n- Apply aggressively to roles you qualify for\n- Consider temporary or contract work\n- Part-time can bridge the gap\n- Do not be too selective early on\n\n### Job Search Budget\n\nSome expenses are investment:\n- Resume printing\n- Interview clothes (thrift if possible)\n- Transportation to interviews\n- Professional certifications\n\nBudget small amount for job search essentials.\n\n## Emergency Fund Recovery\n\nIf you are using emergency fund:\n\n- This is exactly what it is for\n- Do not feel guilty\n- Plan to rebuild once employed\n\nIf you have no emergency fund:\n\n- This is why it matters\n- Survive this situation\n- Commit to building one once income returns\n\n## When Things Get Critical\n\n### If Running Out of Money\n\n**Last resort options:**\n- 401(k) withdrawal (taxes and penalties, avoid if possible)\n- Retirement loan (better than withdrawal)\n- Family help\n- Local emergency assistance\n- Food banks\n\n**Prioritize in order:**\n1. Food\n2. Housing\n3. Utilities\n4. Transportation (to find work)\n5. Everything else\n\n### Getting Help\n\n**Free resources:**\n- 211: Connect to local services\n- SNAP: Food assistance\n- Food banks: Immediate food needs\n- Community organizations: Various assistance\n- Religious organizations: Often help regardless of faith\n\nUsing these resources is not failure. They exist for this situation.\n\n## Mental Health Matters\n\nJob loss affects mental health. Protect yourself.\n\n**Healthy practices:**\n- Maintain routine (wake up, get dressed, structure day)\n- Exercise (free outdoor activity)\n- Stay connected to people\n- Limit time on social media\n- Separate self-worth from employment status\n\n**Warning signs to address:**\n- Extended hopelessness\n- Inability to function\n- Isolation\n- Thoughts of self-harm\n\n**Free resources:** 988 (mental health crisis line), community mental health centers, support groups.\n\n## When You Get a New Job\n\n### Rebuild Financial Foundation\n\n1. Replenish emergency fund (before lifestyle returns)\n2. Resume retirement contributions\n3. Pay back any hardship deferrals\n4. Gradually restore normal spending\n\n### Learn From the Experience\n\n- Build larger emergency fund (6-12 months for future)\n- Diversify income if possible\n- Keep skills current\n- Maintain professional network\n- Never take job security for granted\n\n## Timeline: Your Action Plan\n\n### Day 1-2\n- Process emotions\n- File unemployment claim\n- Assess cash situation\n\n### Week 1\n- Create emergency budget\n- Cut all non-essential expenses\n- Contact creditors about hardship options\n- Begin job search\n- Apply for assistance if eligible\n\n### Week 2-4\n- Fully implement reduced budget\n- Active job searching\n- Consider interim income options\n- Track all spending\n\n### Month 2+\n- Maintain budget discipline\n- Adjust as situation develops\n- Continue aggressive job search\n- Celebrate small wins\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nJob loss is a crisis.
