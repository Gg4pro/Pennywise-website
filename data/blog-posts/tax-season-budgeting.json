  "content": "## Tax Season and Your Budget\n\nTax season brings one of two outcomes:\n\n1. **You owe money:** A bill you need to pay\n2. **You get a refund:** A windfall to manage wisely\n\nBoth affect your budget. Plan for whichever is coming. Having the right [budgeting method](/blog/complete-guide-budgeting-methods-2026) makes tax planning easier.\n\n## If You Expect to Owe\n\n### Why You Might Owe\n\n- Withholding is set too low\n- Multiple jobs with each withholding at lower rate\n- Significant investment gains\n- Self-employment or gig income\n- Life changes (marriage, divorce, new house)\n\n### Preparing for a Tax Bill\n\n**Estimate now:**\n- Use IRS Tax Withholding Estimator\n- Compare expected income to current withholding\n- Calculate approximate liability\n\n**Save for it:**\n- Set aside monthly toward tax bill\n- Open separate tax savings account\n- Self-employed: Save 25-30% of income\n\n**Adjust withholding:**\n- File new W-4 with employer\n- Increase withholding to reduce future bills\n\n### If You Cannot Pay the Full Amount\n\n**Options:**\n- IRS payment plan (installment agreement)\n- Credit card (last resort, high interest)\n- Borrow from emergency fund and replenish\n\n**Do not:**\n- Ignore it (penalties compound)\n- Not file (filing late has additional penalties)\n\n## If You Expect a Refund\n\n### The Refund Reality\n\nA tax refund is not a gift. It is your money that you overpaid throughout the year, returned without interest.\n\nThat said, for many people, refunds are the largest lump sum they receive all year. Use it wisely.\n\n### Best Uses for Tax Refund\n\n**Priority 1: Emergency fund**\nIf you do not have $1,000+ saved, this is the best use. Our [emergency fund calculator](/blog/emergency-fund-calculator) helps you set the right target.\n\n**Priority 2: High-interest debt**\nPaying $1,500 toward 24% credit card debt saves real money. See our guide on [debt snowball vs avalanche](/blog/debt-snowball-vs-avalanche) to choose your payoff strategy.\n\n**Priority 3: Necessary expenses**\nDeferred car repairs, medical needs, home repairs.\n\n**Priority 4: Goal acceleration**\nDown payment fund, major purchase savings, investment accounts.\n\n**Priority 5: Enjoyment**\nAfter priorities are handled, some fun is okay.\n\n### The Refund Split Strategy\n\nDo not choose one thing. Split the refund:\n\n**Example: $2,400 refund**\n- 50% to emergency fund: $1,200\n- 30% to debt: $720\n- 20% for enjoyment: $480\n\nYou make progress on goals AND enjoy some of it.\n\n### Refund Traps to Avoid\n\n**Trap 1: Refund anticipation loans**\nHigh-fee products that cost you money to get your own money faster. Wait for free direct deposit.\n\n**Trap 2: Treating it as bonus**\nThis is not extra money. It is money you already earned. Treat it with the same intention as regular income.\n\n**Trap 3: No plan**\nWithout a plan, refunds evaporate into general spending. Decide how to use it before it arrives.\n\n**Trap 4: Lifestyle inflation**\nOne nice dinner is fine. Using refund to justify ongoing lifestyle increases is not.\n\n## Planning Before Filing\n\n### Gather Documents\n\n**Income documents:**\n- W-2s (from employers)\n- 1099s (investment, freelance, gig income)\n- 1099-G (unemployment)\n- Year-end pay stubs\n\n**Deduction documents:**\n- Mortgage interest (1098)\n- Student loan interest (1098-E)\n- Property taxes paid\n- Charitable donations\n- Medical expenses (if over 7.5% of income)\n- State/local taxes paid\n\n### Choose Filing Method\n\n**Free options:**\n- IRS Free File (if income under $79,000)\n- VITA (Volunteer Income Tax Assistance)\n- Some library/community programs\n\n**Paid options:**\n- Tax software ($20-100+)\n- Professional preparer ($200-500+)\n\nSimple returns often do not need professional help.\n\n## Adjusting Withholding\n\n### The Goal\n\nIdeal withholding: Small refund or small amount owed (under $500 either way).\n\n**Large refund** = You gave the government an interest-free loan\n**Large bill** = You need to come up with cash at tax time\n\n### How to Adjust\n\n1. Use IRS Withholding Estimator\n2. Complete new W-4 based on results\n3. Submit to employer\n\n### When to Adjust\n\n- After major life changes (marriage, divorce, baby, home purchase)\n- If you owed more than $500 last year\n- If refund was more than $1,500\n- When starting new job\n\n## Year-Round Tax Planning\n\n### Track Deductible Expenses\n\nUse [Pennywise](https://apps.apple.com/si/app/pennywise-finance-tracker/id6754343519) to track expenses that might be deductible:\n- Charitable donations\n- Medical expenses\n- Work-related expenses (if self-employed)\n\n### Quarterly Estimated Taxes\n\nIf you have self-employment income, you may need to pay quarterly:\n- Q1: April 15\n- Q2: June 15\n- Q3: September 15\n- Q4: January 15\n\n### Tax-Advantaged Contributions\n\nMaximize tax-advantaged accounts before year-end:\n- 401(k) reduces taxable income\n- Traditional IRA may be deductible\n- HSA contributions are triple tax-advantaged\n\n## Tax Season Timeline\n\n**January:**\n- Gather documents as they arrive\n- Organize in one folder\n\n**February:**\n- All documents should be received by mid-February\n- Review for completeness\n\n**March:**\n- File early if expecting refund\n- Refund arrives faster\n\n**April:**\n- Deadline is April 15 (or next business day)\n- File extension if needed (extends filing, not payment)\n\n## Creating a Tax Sinking Fund\n\nIf you regularly owe, create a tax sinking fund:\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Last year owed: $2,400\n- Monthly set-aside: $200\n- Result: Money ready at tax time\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nTax season is predictable. There is no reason to be surprised by owing or unsure what to do with a refund.\n\n- Estimate what is coming\n- Plan how to handle it\n- Use refunds wisely\n- Adjust withholding to optimize\n- Track throughout the year\n\nTaxes are part of your overall financial picture. Budget for them accordingly.\n\n---\n\n*Track your tax-deductible expenses year-round with Pennywise. Download and stay organized.*"
