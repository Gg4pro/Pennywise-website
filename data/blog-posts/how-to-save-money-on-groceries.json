  "content": "## The Real Cost of Groceries\n\nThe average household spends between $400 and $800 per month on groceries. That is $5,000 to $10,000 per year on food alone. Even small percentage savings can add up to hundreds of dollars annually.\n\nThe good news? You can significantly reduce your grocery bill without resorting to extreme couponing or sacrificing nutrition.\n\n## 12 Strategies to Cut Your Grocery Bill\n\n### 1. Make a List and Stick to It\n\nThis sounds basic, but it is the foundation of grocery savings. Studies show that shoppers without a list spend 20-30% more than planned. Before you shop:\n\n- Check what you already have\n- Plan your meals for the week\n- Write down only what you need\n- Resist impulse purchases\n\n### 2. Never Shop Hungry\n\nShopping on an empty stomach leads to impulse purchases. Eat a snack before you go, and you will make more rational decisions.\n\n### 3. Try Store Brands\n\nGeneric and store-brand products are typically 20-40% cheaper than name brands. In many cases, they are made in the same factories with nearly identical ingredients.\n\n### 4. Buy in Bulk Strategically\n\nBulk buying saves money on non-perishables you use regularly. But avoid bulk purchases of:\n\n- Items you have never tried before\n- Perishables you might not finish\n- Things you already have plenty of\n\n### 5. Shop Seasonally\n\nFruits and vegetables are cheapest when they are in season locally. Out-of-season produce is shipped from far away and costs more.\n\n### 6. Use the Pennywise Food Category\n\nTrack every grocery purchase in [Pennywise](https://apps.apple.com/si/app/pennywise-finance-tracker/id6754343519). After a month, you will see exactly where your food money goes. Most people discover surprising patterns.\n\n### 7. Compare Unit Prices\n\nThe biggest package is not always the best deal. Always check the unit price (price per ounce, pound, or count) to make true comparisons.\n\n### 8. Reduce Meat Consumption\n\nMeat is typically the most expensive item in your grocery cart. Try having one or two meatless dinners per week.\n\n### 9. Plan Around Sales\n\nCheck weekly ads before planning meals. Build your menu around what is on sale rather than the other way around.\n\n### 10. Avoid Pre-Cut and Pre-Prepared\n\nWhole vegetables, unsliced cheese, and uncooked meals are almost always cheaper than their prepared counterparts. Pay for convenience only when you truly need it.\n\n### 11. Freeze Strategically\n\nBuy meat and bread in bulk when on sale and freeze them. Freeze leftover portions before they go bad. A well-organized freezer is a money-saving tool.\n\n### 12. Track and Review Monthly\n\nUse Pennywise to track your grocery spending for at least three months. Identify patterns, set a realistic target, and work toward it gradually.\n\n## How Much Can You Really Save?\n\nIf you implement just half of these strategies, you can realistically save 15-25% on groceries. For a household spending $600 per month, that is $90 to $150 in monthly savings, or $1,080 to $1,800 per year.\n\n## Your Action Plan\n\n1. Download Pennywise and create a \"Groceries\" category\n2. Track every food purchase for one month\n3. Review your data and identify your top 3 opportunities\n4. Implement changes gradually\n5. Track results and adjust\n\n---\n\n*Start tracking your grocery spending today with Pennywise. See exactly where your food budget goes and find opportunities to save.*"
