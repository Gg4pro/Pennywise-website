You likely earn more than ever but face expenses your 20s self never imagined:\n\n- Housing costs (or saving for a house)\n- Wedding and marriage expenses\n- Childcare (possibly the cost of a second mortgage)\n- Career investment and advancement\n- Supporting aging parents\n- Lifestyle expectations from peers\n\nMeanwhile, retirement is close enough to matter but far enough to procrastinate.\n\nThis decade determines your financial trajectory more than any other.\n\n## The Core 30s Financial Priorities\n\n### Priority 1: Max Out Employer Retirement Match\n\nIf you are not already, contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is free money with guaranteed 50-100% returns.\n\n**Example:** Employer matches 50% up to 6% of salary.\n- Your contribution (6%): $3,600/year\n- Employer match: $1,800/year\n- **Total to retirement: $5,400/year**\n\nSkipping this is leaving $1,800+ on the table.\n\n### Priority 2: Full Emergency Fund\n\nIf you do not have 3-6 months of expenses saved, this is critical.\n\n**Why it matters more in your 30s:**\n- More people depend on your income\n- Mortgage or higher rent creates higher stakes\n- Job transitions may take longer with specialized skills\n- Medical expenses increase with family\n\nTarget: 6 months if single income with dependents. 3-4 months if dual income, no dependents.\n\n### Priority 3: Eliminate High-Interest Debt\n\nCredit card debt, personal loans, or any debt above 8% should be aggressively eliminated.\n\n**The math:** Paying off 20% credit card debt guarantees a 20% return. No investment matches that.\n\n### Priority 4: Increase Retirement Savings\n\nBeyond the match, push toward 15-20% of income to retirement. The money you invest in your 30s has 30+ years to grow.\n\n**The compounding difference:**\n- $500/month starting at 35 = ~$566,000 by 65\n- $500/month starting at 25 = ~$1,140,000 by 65\n\nTime is your most valuable asset. Do not waste it.\n\n### Priority 5: Protect Your Income\n\nIf others depend on your income, you need:\n\n**Term life insurance:** Cheap in your 30s. Get 10-15x annual income in coverage.\n\n**Disability insurance:** More likely to be needed than life insurance. Check employer coverage; supplement if needed.\n\n## Common 30s Budget Categories\n\nA typical 30s budget looks different from your 20s:\n\n### Housing (25-30%)\n\nLikely your biggest expense. Whether renting or owning, keep total housing costs (mortgage/rent, insurance, taxes, maintenance) under 30% of gross income.\n\n**The house trap:** Do not buy the most house you can afford. Leave room for life.\n\n### Childcare (0-25%)\n\nIf you have young children, childcare may cost $1,000-3,000+ per month depending on location. This is often the second-largest expense after housing.\n\nBudget for it before having kids if possible.\n\n### Transportation (10-15%)\n\nCar payments, insurance, maintenance, gas. In your 30s, reliability matters more than showing off.\n\n### Food (10-12%)\n\nGroceries plus dining out. With family, grocery costs rise significantly.\n\n### Savings and Investing (15-20%)\n\n- Retirement accounts\n- Emergency fund (until full)\n- Other goals (house down payment, college fund)\n\n### Insurance (5-8%)\n\nHealth, life, disability, auto, home/renters. Coverage needs increase in your 30s.\n\n### Everything Else (15-20%)\n\nPersonal, entertainment, subscriptions, clothing, gifts, hobbies, childcare items beyond daycare.\n\n## Sample 30s Budget: Young Family\n\n**Household income: $120,000 gross ($8,500/month net after taxes)**\n\n| Category | Amount | % |\n|----------|--------|---|\n| Mortgage + insurance + taxes | $2,200 | 26% |\n| Childcare | $1,400 | 16% |\n| Groceries | $700 | 8% |\n| Utilities | $250 | 3% |\n| Car payment | $400 | 5% |\n| Car insurance + gas | $300 | 4% |\n| Health insurance (family) | $400 | 5% |\n| Life/disability insurance | $100 | 1% |\n| Retirement (401k) | $1,000 | 12% |\n| Emergency/college savings | $400 | 5% |\n| Dining out | $200 | 2% |\n| Entertainment | $100 | 1% |\n| Kids activities | $150 | 2% |\n| Personal/clothing | $200 | 2% |\n| Subscriptions | $80 | 1% |\n| Miscellaneous | $520 | 6% |\n| **Total** | **$8,500** | **100%** |\n\n## Sample 30s Budget: Single Professional\n\n**Income: $85,000 gross ($5,500/month net)**\n\n| Category | Amount | % |\n|----------|--------|---|\n| Rent | $1,600 | 29% |\n| Utilities + internet | $150 | 3% |\n| Groceries | $350 | 6% |\n| Transportation | $500 | 9% |\n| Health insurance | $200 | 4% |\n| Retirement (401k + IRA) | $900 | 16% |\n| Savings | $400 | 7% |\n| Dining out | $300 | 5% |\n| Entertainment | $200 | 4% |\n| Travel fund | $200 | 4% |\n| Personal | $200 | 4% |\n| Subscriptions | $80 | 1% |\n| Miscellaneous | $420 | 8% |\n| **Total** | **$5,500** | **100%** |\n\n## 30s Financial Mistakes to Avoid\n\n### Mistake 1: House Poor\n\nBuying at the top of what you qualify for leaves no margin. Aim for mortgage payments (including insurance and taxes) under 25% of take-home pay.\n\n### Mistake 2: Lifestyle Creep\n\nEarning more should mean saving more, not just spending more. Lifestyle should grow slower than income.\n\n### Mistake 3: Ignoring Retirement\n\nThinking you will \"catch up later\" is dangerous. The money you invest now matters more than money invested later.\n\n### Mistake 4: Raiding Retirement for House\n\nUsing 401(k) for down payment loses years of compound growth and may incur penalties.\n\n### Mistake 5: No Insurance\n\nYour 30s are when you have the most to lose from disability or death. Coverage is cheap now.\n\n### Mistake 6: Keeping Up With Friends\n\nPeers' spending is not your concern. Their Instagram lifestyle may be funded by debt.\n\n### Mistake 7: All Kids, No Retirement\n\nYour kids can borrow for college. You cannot borrow for retirement. Prioritize your retirement savings.\n\n## Major 30s Financial Decisions\n\n### Buying a House\n\n**Ready when:**\n- 20% down payment saved (or at least 10% + PMI acceptance)\n- Emergency fund intact after down payment\n- Monthly costs under 28% of gross income\n- Planning to stay 5+ years\n- Stable income\n\n**Not ready when:**\n- Would drain emergency fund\n- Debt-to-income ratio too high\n- Job or location uncertain\n- Buying because \"everyone else is\"\n\n### Having Children\n\n**Financial preparation:**\n- Understand true costs (childcare, healthcare, supplies, activities)\n- Build savings before arrival\n- Review health insurance coverage\n- Consider life insurance before pregnancy\n- Discuss career impacts and income changes\n\n### Career Changes\n\n**Financial cushion needed:**\n- 6+ months expenses saved\n- Health insurance plan during transition\n- Reduced spending ability during adjustment\n- Potential income dip while building in new role\n\n## Tracking Your 30s Budget\n\nUse [Pennywise](https://apps.apple.com/si/app/pennywise-finance-tracker/id6754343519) to:\n\n- Track spending across all categories\n- Monitor progress toward savings goals\n- See where money actually goes versus assumptions\n- Adjust as life changes\n\n## 30s Financial Milestones\n\n**By 35:**\n- Emergency fund: 3-6 months expenses\n- Retirement: 2x annual salary saved\n- Debt: High-interest debt eliminated\n- Insurance: Life and disability in place\n\n**By 40:**\n- Retirement: 3x annual salary saved\n- Net worth: Positive and growing\n- Savings rate: 15-20% consistently\n- Major purchases: Funded without debt\n\n## The 30s Opportunity\n\nYour 30s combine rising income with (hopefully) lower student debt burden. This creates opportunity for wealth building.\n\nThe decisions you make now compound for decades:\n- Retirement savings grow for 30+ years\n- House equity builds over time\n- Good habits become automatic\n- Bad habits become expensive\n\nThis decade matters.
