  "content": "## Two Paths to Debt Freedom\n\nWhen paying off multiple debts, you have a choice: which debt to attack first?\n\nThe two most popular strategies:\n\n**Debt Snowball:** Pay smallest balance first, regardless of interest rate\n\n**Debt Avalanche:** Pay highest interest rate first, regardless of balance\n\nBoth work. The best choice depends on you. Whichever you choose, having the right [budgeting method](/blog/complete-guide-budgeting-methods-2026) in place helps you find extra money for debt payoff.\n\n## The Debt Snowball Method\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. List all debts from smallest balance to largest\n2. Make minimum payments on all debts\n3. Put all extra money toward the smallest debt\n4. When smallest is paid off, roll that payment to the next smallest\n5. Repeat until debt-free\n\n### Example\n\n**Debts:**\n- Store card: $500 at 25% APR (minimum $25)\n- Credit card: $3,000 at 18% APR (minimum $90)\n- Car loan: $8,000 at 6% APR (minimum $200)\n\n**Extra monthly payment available: $200**\n\n**Snowball approach:**\n- Month 1-3: $225 to store card (paid off in ~2.5 months)\n- Month 4-10: $315 to credit card (paid off in ~10 months)\n- Month 11+: $515 to car loan\n\n### Advantages\n\n**Quick wins:** Smallest debt disappears fast. Victory feels good.\n\n**Momentum:** Each payoff motivates the next. You see progress early.\n\n**Simplicity:** Easy to understand and follow. No calculations needed.\n\n**Psychological boost:** Checking off debts keeps motivation high.\n\n### Disadvantages\n\n**Costs more:** Ignoring interest rates means paying more total interest.\n\n**Not mathematically optimal:** Your accountant brain knows this is inefficient.\n\n## The Debt Avalanche Method\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. List all debts from highest interest rate to lowest\n2. Make minimum payments on all debts\n3. Put all extra money toward the highest interest debt\n4. When highest rate debt is paid, move to next highest rate\n5. Repeat until debt-free\n\n### Example (Same debts)\n\n**Debts ordered by rate:**\n- Store card: $500 at 25% APR (minimum $25)\n- Credit card: $3,000 at 18% APR (minimum $90)\n- Car loan: $8,000 at 6% APR (minimum $200)\n\n**Extra monthly payment available: $200**\n\n**Avalanche approach:**\n- Month 1-3: $225 to store card (same as snowball since it is also highest rate)\n- Month 4-14: $315 to credit card\n- Month 15+: $515 to car loan\n\nIn this example, snowball and avalanche happen to be the same order.\n\n### Different Example\n\n**Debts:**\n- Store card: $2,000 at 22% APR\n- Credit card: $500 at 18% APR\n- Personal loan: $5,000 at 12% APR\n\n**Snowball order:** Credit card ($500) → Store card ($2,000) → Personal loan ($5,000)\n\n**Avalanche order:** Store card (22%) → Credit card (18%) → Personal loan (12%)\n\nHere they differ. Avalanche saves money. Snowball builds wins faster.\n\n### Advantages\n\n**Saves money:** Less total interest paid over time.\n\n**Mathematically optimal:** This is the efficient approach.\n\n**Good for large high-interest debt:** If your biggest debt also has the highest rate.\n\n### Disadvantages\n\n**Slower wins:** May take longer to pay off first debt.\n\n**Requires discipline:** Without quick victories, motivation can fade.\n\n**Can feel abstract:** Seeing interest savings is less satisfying than seeing debts disappear.\n\n## The Math: How Much Does It Matter?\n\n### Calculation Example\n\n**Debts:**\n- Credit card A: $5,000 at 22% APR\n- Credit card B: $2,000 at 15% APR\n- Personal loan: $10,000 at 8% APR\n\n**Monthly payment available: $700 (minimums plus extra)**\n\n**Snowball approach:**\n- Total interest paid: $3,847\n- Debt-free in: 28 months\n\n**Avalanche approach:**\n- Total interest paid: $3,214\n- Debt-free in: 27 months\n\n**Difference:** Avalanche saves $633 and one month.\n\n### When the Difference Is Small\n\nIf your debts have similar interest rates, the methods produce similar results. Pick based on preference.\n\n### When the Difference Is Large\n\nWith big rate differences ($50,000 at 24% vs. $5,000 at 8%), avalanche saves significantly more.\n\n## Which Method Is Right for You?\n\n### Choose Snowball If:\n\n- You need quick wins to stay motivated\n- You have abandoned debt payoff plans before\n- Your debts have similar interest rates\n- You respond better to visible progress\n- Psychology matters more than optimization\n\n### Choose Avalanche If:\n\n- You are motivated by saving money\n- You have discipline to stick with long-term plans\n- You have significant high-interest debt\n- The math matters to you\n- You will not get discouraged by slow early progress\n\n### The Hybrid Approach\n\nSome people compromise:\n\n1. Pay off one small debt for a quick win (snowball)\n2. Then switch to avalanche for the rest\n\nThis gets momentum started, then optimizes.\n\n## The Best Method Is The One You Follow\n\nHere is the truth that matters more than math:\n\n**Avalanche on paper, abandoned in practice:** $0 saved\n**Snowball followed consistently:** Debt-free\n\nThe mathematically optimal plan you quit is worse than the suboptimal plan you complete.\n\nKnow yourself. Choose accordingly.\n\n## Making Either Method Work\n\n### Step 1: List All Debts\n\nFor each debt, note:\n- Creditor name\n- Current balance\n- Interest rate (APR)\n- Minimum payment\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Available Extra Payment\n\nHow much above minimum payments can you throw at debt?\n\nMore is better. Even $50 extra accelerates payoff significantly.\n\n### Step 3: Order Your Debts\n\nSnowball: Smallest to largest balance\nAvalanche: Highest to lowest interest rate\n\n### Step 4: Attack First Debt\n\nAll minimums paid on all debts. All extra goes to target debt.\n\n### Step 5: Roll Over Payments\n\nWhen debt 1 is paid, add its payment to debt 2's payment. The \"snowball\" grows.\n\n### Step 6: Track Progress\n\nUse [Pennywise](https://apps.apple.com/si/app/pennywise-finance-tracker/id6754343519) to track your debt balances monthly. Watch them shrink.\n\n## Staying Motivated Either Way\n\n### Visualize Progress\n\n- Debt payoff tracker on the wall\n- Spreadsheet showing declining balances\n- App that celebrates milestones\n\n### Celebrate Victories\n\n- Debt paid off? Small celebration (budget-appropriate)\n- Milestone reached? Acknowledge it\n- One year of consistent payments? Reward yourself\n\n### Remember Why\n\n- What will you do when debt-free?\n- How will it feel?\n- Keep this vision present\n\n### Find Community\n\n- Partner accountability\n- Online communities (r/debtfree, etc.)\n- Friends with similar goals\n\n## Common Questions\n\n**Should I stop retirement contributions to pay debt faster?**\n\nGenerally, keep contributing at least enough to get employer match. That is free money (100% return). Our [guide to how much of your paycheck to save](/blog/how-much-paycheck-to-save) covers balancing savings and debt payoff.\n\n**What about mortgage?**\n\nMortgage is different: lower rate, tax-deductible, builds equity. Often excluded from these methods. Focus on consumer debt first.\n\n**What if I get a windfall?**\n\nApply it to your target debt. Big windfalls can eliminate entire debts at once.\n\n**What if minimum payments are already hard?**\n\nBefore either method, address the income/expense problem. You cannot pay extra if there is no extra. See our guide on [stopping the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle](/blog/stop-living-paycheck-to-paycheck) for help.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\n**Debt Avalanche:** Saves money, requires patience\n**Debt Snowball:** Builds momentum, costs slightly more\n\nBoth work. Both beat making only minimum payments.\n\nPick the one you will stick with, then start today.\n\n---\n\n*Track your debt payoff journey with Pennywise. Download and watch your balances drop.*"
