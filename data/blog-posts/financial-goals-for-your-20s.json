  "content": "## Why Your 20s Matter So Much\n\nYour 20s are the most powerful decade for building wealth. Not because you will earn the most money, but because time is your greatest asset. Money invested in your 20s has decades to compound.\n\nSomeone who invests $5,000 per year from age 25-35 and then stops will have more at retirement than someone who invests $5,000 per year from age 35-65. That is the power of starting early.\n\n## Goal 1: Build a Starter Emergency Fund\n\nBefore anything else, save $1,000 for emergencies. This small cushion prevents you from going into debt when unexpected expenses arise.\n\n**Action steps:**\n- Open a separate savings account\n- Set up automatic transfers of $100-200 per month\n- Do not touch this money except for true emergencies\n\n## Goal 2: Understand Where Your Money Goes\n\nYou cannot improve what you do not measure. Track every expense for at least 3 months to understand your spending patterns.\n\n**Action steps:**\n- Download [Pennywise](https://apps.apple.com/si/app/pennywise-finance-tracker/id6754343519)\n- Track every expense for 90 days\n- Review your data monthly\n\n## Goal 3: Pay Off High-Interest Debt\n\nCredit card debt with 20%+ interest rates is a financial emergency. Make paying this off a top priority.\n\n**Action steps:**\n- List all debts with interest rates\n- Focus extra payments on highest interest debt\n- Consider balance transfer options\n\n## Goal 4: Start Retirement Savings\n\nIf your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. That is free money.\n\n**Action steps:**\n- Enroll in your employer retirement plan\n- Contribute at least enough to get the full match\n- Increase contributions by 1% each year\n\n## Goal 5: Build Your Full Emergency Fund\n\nOnce high-interest debt is paid off, build your emergency fund to 3-6 months of expenses.\n\n**Action steps:**\n- Calculate your monthly essential expenses\n- Multiply by 3 (or 6 if income is unstable)\n- Automate savings until you reach this target\n\n## Goal 6: Learn to Live Below Your Means\n\nThe most important financial skill is spending less than you earn. This is what creates the gap that funds everything else.\n\n**Action steps:**\n- Target saving at least 20% of income\n- Avoid lifestyle inflation as income grows\n- Find fulfillment in experiences over things\n\n## Goal 7: Build Good Credit\n\nGood credit affects your ability to rent apartments, get loans, and even get certain jobs. Start building credit early.\n\n**Action steps:**\n- Get a credit card if you do not have one\n- Use it for small regular purchases\n- Pay the full balance every month\n- Never use more than 30% of your limit\n\n## The Compound Effect\n\nSmall actions in your 20s lead to massive results later:\n\n- Saving $200 per month starting at 25 could become $500,000+ by retirement\n- Building good credit now saves tens of thousands in interest over your lifetime\n- Habits formed in your 20s tend to stick for life\n\n## Your Action Plan for This Month\n\n1. Download Pennywise and track all expenses\n2. Open a savings account for your emergency fund\n3. Set up automatic savings of at least $100\n4. Check if your employer offers retirement matching\n\n---\n\n*Your financial future starts today. Download Pennywise and begin building the habits that will serve you for decades.*"
