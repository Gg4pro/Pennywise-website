  "content": "## The True Cost of Home Ownership\n\nYour mortgage payment is not your housing cost. It is the starting point.\n\nFirst-time homeowners are often shocked by expenses that renters never face. This guide covers every cost so you can budget realistically. Home ownership is one of the major [financial life transitions](/blog/budgeting-life-stages-complete-guide) that requires careful planning.\n\n## Before You Buy: Upfront Costs\n\n### Down Payment\n\nTypical requirements:\n- Conventional loan: 3-20%\n- FHA loan: 3.5%\n- VA loan: 0%\n\n**On a $300,000 home:**\n- 3% down: $9,000\n- 10% down: $30,000\n- 20% down: $60,000\n\n### Closing Costs\n\nExpect 2-5% of purchase price.\n\n**Includes:**\n- Loan origination fees\n- Appraisal\n- Title insurance\n- Attorney fees\n- Recording fees\n- Prepaid taxes and insurance\n\n**On $300,000 home: $6,000-15,000**\n\n### Moving Costs\n\n- DIY with truck rental: $200-500\n- Local movers: $500-2,000\n- Long-distance movers: $2,000-5,000+\n\n### Immediate Repairs and Purchases\n\nThings you need right away:\n- Locks changed: $100-300\n- Basic tools: $200-500\n- Lawn mower (if applicable): $200-500\n- Window treatments: $200-1,000+\n- Light bulbs and batteries: $50-100\n\n**Budget at least $1,000-3,000 for move-in essentials.**\n\n## Monthly Housing Costs\n\n### Your Mortgage Payment (PITI)\n\nMonthly mortgage includes:\n\n**Principal:** Paying down the loan\n**Interest:** Cost of borrowing\n**Taxes:** Property taxes (escrowed)\n**Insurance:** Homeowner's insurance (escrowed)\n\n### Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)\n\nIf down payment is less than 20%:\n- Typically 0.5-1% of loan annually\n- On $285,000 loan: $120-240/month\n- Removed once you have 20% equity\n\n### HOA Fees\n\nIf applicable:\n- Condos: $200-600/month typical\n- HOA neighborhoods: $50-200/month typical\n- Covers shared maintenance, amenities, insurance\n\n### Utilities (Often Higher Than Renting)\n\n**You now pay for everything:**\n- Electricity\n- Gas/heating\n- Water and sewer\n- Trash pickup\n- Internet\n\n**Larger space = higher utilities.** Budget 20-30% more than your apartment.\n\n## Ongoing Maintenance Costs\n\n### The 1% Rule\n\nBudget 1% of home value annually for maintenance. Setting up [sinking funds](/blog/sinking-fund-categories) for these expenses makes managing them easier.\n\n**$300,000 home = $3,000/year = $250/month**\n\nSome years you spend less. Some years much more. Average it out.\n\n### The Replacement Timeline\n\nMajor systems have lifespans:\n\n| Item | Lifespan | Replacement Cost |\n|------|----------|------------------|\n| Roof | 20-30 years | $8,000-15,000 |\n| HVAC | 15-20 years | $5,000-10,000 |\n| Water heater | 10-15 years | $1,000-2,000 |\n| Appliances | 10-15 years | $500-2,000 each |\n| Windows | 20-30 years | $300-1,000 each |\n| Exterior paint | 7-10 years | $3,000-6,000 |\n\nKnow the age of systems when you buy.\n\n### Seasonal Maintenance\n\n**Spring:**\n- HVAC service: $100-200\n- Gutter cleaning: $100-200\n- Lawn care startup: $100-300\n\n**Summer:**\n- Lawn maintenance: $50-200/month\n- Pest control: $100-200/quarter\n\n**Fall:**\n- Gutter cleaning: $100-200\n- Furnace service: $100-200\n- Weatherization: $50-200\n\n**Winter:**\n- Snow removal (if applicable): $50-200/month or equipment purchase\n- Higher heating costs\n\n## The Hidden Costs Nobody Mentions\n\n### Property Tax Increases\n\nYour property tax can increase annually. Budget for 2-5% increases.\n\n### Insurance Increases\n\nHomeowner's insurance rises over time. Shop every 2-3 years.\n\n### Landscaping\n\nRenters: Included\nHomeowners: Your problem\n\n- Basic lawn care: $50-200/month\n- Tree trimming: $200-1,000/year\n- Mulch and plants: $200-500/year\n\n### Pest Control\n\n- Preventive quarterly service: $100-200/quarter\n- Termite treatment: $500-2,500 if needed\n\n### Emergency Repairs\n\nThings break without warning:\n- Burst pipe: $500-2,500\n- Furnace failure: $500-5,000\n- Roof leak: $500-3,000\n- Electrical issues: $200-1,000\n\n**This is why emergency funds matter more for homeowners.** Use our [emergency fund calculator](/blog/emergency-fund-calculator) to determine your target.\n\n### The Stuff Accumulation\n\nLarger space means buying more:\n- Furniture for new rooms\n- Garage organization\n- Outdoor furniture\n- Tools and equipment\n\nBudget for gradual furnishing, not all at once.\n\n## First-Time Homeowner Budget Example\n\n**Home purchase price:** $300,000\n**Down payment:** 10% ($30,000)\n**Loan amount:** $270,000 at 6.5%\n\n### Monthly Budget\n\n| Category | Amount |\n|----------|--------|\n| Principal and interest | $1,706 |\n| Property tax (escrow) | $300 |\n| Insurance (escrow) | $150 |\n| PMI | $170 |\n| **Total mortgage payment** | **$2,326** |\n| | |\n| Utilities | $300 |\n| Maintenance reserve | $250 |\n| Lawn care | $100 |\n| Pest control | $50 |\n| **Total housing cost** | **$3,026** |\n\n**Compare to rent:** If rent was $1,800, true ownership cost is 68% higher.\n\n## How to Budget for Home Ownership\n\n### Before Buying\n\n1. **Save for down payment** (3-20% of price)\n2. **Save for closing costs** (2-5% of price)\n3. **Save for move-in expenses** ($3,000-5,000)\n4. **Maintain emergency fund** (6 months expenses with new housing costs)\n\n### After Buying\n\n1. **Create maintenance sinking fund** ($200-400/month)\n2. **Adjust budget for higher utilities**\n3. **Track all home expenses** to understand true costs\n4. **Save for known upcoming repairs**\n\n### Track Everything\n\nUse [Pennywise](https://apps.apple.com/si/app/pennywise-finance-tracker/id6754343519) to:\n\n- Separate home expenses from other spending\n- Track maintenance and repair costs\n- Monitor utility trends\n- Plan for major purchases\n\n## Red Flags: When You Cannot Afford It\n\n**Reconsider if:**\n\n- Total housing cost exceeds 30% of gross income\n- You cannot save for maintenance\n- Emergency fund will be depleted by purchase\n- You need to borrow for closing costs\n- The payment is \"stretch\" tight\n\n**The 28/36 Rule:**\n- Housing costs should not exceed 28% of gross income\n- Total debt payments should not exceed 36% of gross income\n\n## First Year Homeowner Mistakes\n\n### Mistake 1: No Maintenance Budget\n\nThings break. Without savings, you use credit cards. Debt accumulates.\n\n### Mistake 2: Renovating Immediately\n\nLive in the house first. Learn what you actually need. Avoid expensive regrets.\n\n### Mistake 3: Furnishing All at Once\n\nEmpty rooms can wait. Debt cannot.\n\n### Mistake 4: Ignoring Small Problems\n\nSmall leak becomes big leak. Address issues early.\n\n### Mistake 5: Not Shopping Insurance\n\nGet quotes annually. Savings can be significant.\n\n## Building Home Equity\n\nGood news: Unlike rent, mortgage payments build equity.\n\n**Ways to build faster:**\n- Extra principal payments\n- Bi-weekly payments (one extra payment per year)\n- Home improvements that add value\n- Market appreciation (not guaranteed)\n\n**Do not rely on:** Home values always going up. Markets fluctuate.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nHome ownership costs more than the mortgage. Budget for:\n\n1. PITI (Principal, Interest, Taxes, Insurance)\n2. PMI if under 20% down\n3. HOA fees if applicable\n4. Utilities (higher than renting)\n5. Maintenance reserve (1% of home value annually)\n6. Landscaping and outdoor maintenance\n7. Emergency fund for repairs\n\nOwning a home can be financially rewarding, but only if you budget realistically from the start.\n\n---\n\n*New homeowner?
