## Keyword Combinations Apple Will Auto-Create

Based on the new metadata, Apple will index combinations like:

**High Priority:**
- budget tracker ✅
- expense tracker ✅
- money tracker ✅
- budget planner ✅
- savings tracker ✅
- spending tracker ✅

**Niche Targeting:**
- simple budget ✅
- couple budget ✅
- easy budget ✅
- personal budget ✅
- envelope budget ✅

**Long-tail:**
- simple budget tracker ✅
- budget tracker for couples ✅
- easy expense tracker ✅
- personal money saver ✅

---

## Why These Changes

### Title Change: "Finance Tracker" → "Budget Tracker"

| Metric | Finance Tracker | Budget Tracker |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| Popularity | 35 | Higher combined with "budget" keywords |
| Current Rank | #201 | Not ranking |
| Search Intent | General finance | Specific budgeting |

"Budget" keywords have significantly higher search volume and user intent alignment with Pennywise's core functionality.

### Subtitle Change: "Smart Budget & Money Tracker" → "Simple Expense & Money Saver"

**Before:** "Smart Budget & Money Tracker"
- "budget" = repeated from new title ❌
- "tracker" = repeated from title ❌
- "smart" = low search volume

**After:** "Simple Expense & Money Saver"
- "simple" = differentiator keyword (Pop 24, Diff 58)
- "expense" = high-value keyword (Pop 40)
- "saver" = captures "save money" searches
- No repeats ✅

### Keywords Field Overhaul

**Removed (were repeated):**
- budget (now in title)
- tracker (now in title)
- finance (low priority, captured by category)
- expense (now in subtitle)

**Added (new opportunities):**
- couple (low competition niche)
- envelope (budgeting method niche)
- easy (differentiator)
- personal (personal finance searches)

## Screenshot Caption Recommendations

Since screenshot captions are now indexed (2025 algorithm update), consider updating:

| Screenshot | Current Caption | Suggested Caption |

| 2 | [Current] | "Simple Expense Tracking" |
| 3 | [Current] | "Save Money with Smart Goals" |
| 4 | [Current] | "Visual Spending Insights" |
| 5 | [Current] | "Budget Planning Made Easy" |

---

## Rollback Plan

If impressions or downloads drop significantly after 2 weeks:

**Restore to:**
```
Title:    Pennywise - Finance Tracker
Subtitle: Smart Budget & Money Tracker
Keywords: budget,expense,finance,spending,savings,tracker,planner,manager,income,bills,wallet,cash,goals,daily
```

---

## Alternative Options (Not Selected)

### Option A: Conservative
Keep current Title/Subtitle, only fix keyword repetition.
- Lower risk, lower potential reward
- Doesn't address primary keyword issue

### Option C: Aggressive
Title: "Pennywise: Budget Planner"
Subtitle: "Track Expenses & Save Money"
- Higher risk, targets "budget planner" specifically
- Consider for V2 if "budget tracker" shows traction

---

## Version History

| Version | Date | Changes |
|---------|------|---------|
| V1 | Jan 23, 2026 | Initial optimization - fix keyword repetition, target "budget tracker" |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Implement changes** in App Store Connect
2. **Wait 4-6 weeks** before making additional changes
3. **Monitor weekly** in Astro
4. **Document results** for V2 optimization
