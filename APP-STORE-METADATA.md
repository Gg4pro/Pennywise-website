Finally, a budget app that actually works.

Pennywise helps you track spending, save money, and take control of your finances without the stress, spreadsheets, or complicated setup. We built this app for people who are tired of budget apps that feel like work.

Most finance apps overwhelm you with features you will never use. Pennywise does the opposite. We focus on what actually matters: helping you understand your money and save more of it.


WHY PEOPLE LOVE PENNYWISE

Pennywise adapts to your life, not the other way around. Your personalized financial plan is built around your income, your goals, and your spending habits. Whether you are saving for something big or just trying to make it to payday without stress, Pennywise gives you a clear path forward.

We designed every feature to save you time. Adding an expense takes seconds, not minutes. Checking your budget takes one glance, not ten taps. Understanding where your money went takes a quick look at your dashboard, not a spreadsheet.


WHAT YOU GET

Quick Expense Tracking
Add expenses with a single tap. No complicated forms or endless categories. Just open the app, enter the amount, and you are done.

Smart Daily and Monthly Budgets
Set realistic spending limits that match your income and lifestyle. Pennywise breaks down your monthly budget into daily targets so you always know how much you can spend today.

Visual Calendar View
See all your transactions laid out on a calendar. Know exactly what you spent and when. Spot patterns and understand your habits at a glance.

Powerful Insights Dashboard
Understand your spending with clear monthly and yearly breakdowns. See where your money is really going. Find opportunities to save.

Custom Financial Plans
Get a personalized budget based on your actual situation. This is not a generic template. It is a plan built specifically for you.

Savings Goals
Set targets and track your progress. Watch your savings grow with clear visual indicators. Stay motivated by seeing how close you are to your goals.


HOW IT WORKS

First, tell us about your income and financial goals.

Second, we create a custom daily and monthly plan based on your information.

Third, track your expenses as you go. Adding an expense takes literal seconds.

Fourth, watch your progress on your dashboard and adjust as needed.

Fifth, actually save money and feel good about it.


WHO THIS IS FOR

Pennywise is perfect for anyone who wants to take control of their finances without spending hours on budgeting.

Students managing loan money and limited income. Young professionals building their first savings. Parents budgeting for the whole family. Couples planning their financial future together. Anyone who has tried other budget apps and gave up.

If you are tired of living paycheck to paycheck, want to save for something important, or just want to feel less stressed about finances, Pennywise is for you.


THE PENNYWISE DIFFERENCE

We do not connect to your bank account and overwhelm you with data. We do not force you into rigid categories. We do not make you feel bad about spending.

Instead, we help you create a realistic plan, track your progress without effort, and actually reach your financial goals.

Your financial journey is personal. Your budget should be too.


COMING SOON

We are constantly improving Pennywise. Soon you will have access to AI powered financial guidance, bank account connections for automatic tracking, and curated financial tips.

But right now, we are focused on doing one thing exceptionally well: helping you track your money and save more of it.

## Initial ASO Analysis

### Current Strengths
- **Title** includes "Finance Tracker" - good keyword
- **Subtitle** includes "Budget" and "Money Tracker" - relevant keywords
- Good character utilization (26/30 title, 28/30 subtitle)

### Potential Issues to Investigate
1. **Keywords field** - Need to document what's currently there
2. **Title** uses "Finance Tracker" but top keywords are "budget app", "expense tracker"
3. **Subtitle** could potentially be optimized for different keywords

### Keywords Currently in Title/Subtitle (Shouldn't Repeat in Keywords Field)
- pennywise
- finance
- tracker
- smart
- budget
- money

### Current Keywords Field Analysis

**Your 14 keywords:**
budget, expense, finance, spending, savings, tracker, planner, manager, income, bills, wallet, cash, goals, daily

**Issues Found:**
1. ❌ **"budget"** - Already in Subtitle ("Smart Budget & Money Tracker") - WASTED
2. ❌ **"finance"** - Already in Title ("Finance Tracker") - WASTED
3. ❌ **"tracker"** - Already in Title AND Subtitle - WASTED

**Wasted Characters:** ~22 characters on repeated words

**Missing High-Value Keywords:**
- "couple" / "couples" (low competition niche)
- "envelope" (budgeting method)
- "simple" / "easy" (differentiator)
- "free" (high search volume)
- "personal" (personal finance)
- "money" (wait - this IS in subtitle, good you didn't repeat)

**Optimization Opportunity:**
By removing the 3 repeated words, you could add 3-4 new keywords targeting low-competition niches.
